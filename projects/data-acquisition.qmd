## **Summary**

To get the data, we first needed a list of Disney movies. We scraped this from a **Wikipedia** page, then took our list to a rating website — **Rotten Tomatoes**.  

We identified the pattern for movie URLs and combined it (“Frankensteined” it) using each movie’s name and Rotten Tomatoes’ base URL. After that, we inspected the page to locate the sections we needed and wrapped this process in a `for` loop to collect all the data automatically.  

Then we analyzed it.

## **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**

- **Number of movies analyzed:** 477  
- Some missing values existed in different columns, so some data was excluded from certain analyses.

**Summary statistics:**
- Mean audience rating = 61  
- SD (audience rating) = 19  
- Mean critic rating = 62  
- SD (critic rating) = 27  
- Correlation (audience vs. critic score) = 0.72  
- Mean revenue = \$83,668,368.59  

**Points of interest:**
- R-rated movies earn **significantly less** than any other category.  
- PG-13 movies earn **more** than any other category.  
- Critic and audience scores have become **more correlated** in the last 25 years.  
- The **variance in revenue** has become more extreme over time.  
- The **number of directors** in recent years seems **inversely correlated** with success (more analysis needed).
